Nginx proxy manager: docker-compose deployment

This Docker Compose file deploys an nginx reverse proxy using the "jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest" image. Nginx reverse proxy is used to forward incoming HTTP(S) requests to the appropriate backend server(s) based on the domain name in the request.

The "services" section of the file defines one service named "app". This service exposes three ports: port 80 for HTTP traffic, port 81 for the dashboard UI, and port 443 for HTTPS traffic.

The "restart" option is set to "unless-stopped", which means that the container will automatically restart unless it is stopped manually.

The service also mounts two volumes, one for the data directory and the other for the LetsEncrypt configuration directory. The data volume is used to store the nginx proxy manager data such as the SSL certificates, configuration files, and other persistent data. The LetsEncrypt configuration directory is used to store the SSL certificates generated by LetsEncrypt.

One suggestion I have is to update the container image regularly to get the latest security patches and updates. You can use the "watchtower" image to automatically update the container to the latest version.
